    <h3>How to Use this App</h3>
    <p>
        waitCalc is an app designed for waitstaff to track their tips over the course of a shift.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        When your shift begins, simply set your workplace's tax and tip rates, then each time you complete an order enter the base cost of your customers meal and the calculator will take care of the rest.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        You will be able to track how many transactions you complete, a running average of your tips and, of course, the total tips you've earned in a shift.
